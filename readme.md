# Period tracker algorithm challenge
Hi! This app is created for a Tjejer kodar event hosted by Natural Cycles.
Your challenge is to write an algorithm that will predict when your next period will start.

Do this by using the data that gets presented to you by the app.


## Get started
- Click the green "Clone or download" button and select "Download ZIP"
- From the downloaded folder, open `index.html` in your browser
- Add your days of period to the calendar, you need to add at least two cycles
- Open the whole folder in your favorite editor. If you don't have one, download [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- You will find your challenge in `js/algorithm.js`


## Good luck! :)
